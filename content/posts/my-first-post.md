Yup! This is *indeed* my very first post!

I think its really intresting that you stumbled upon this, because I doubt it is going to be of much use to you! Nevertheless, I’m currently setting up this blog in Hugo, so everything here is in markdown, which I’m starting to really love!

I guess I’ll make a separate post about my experience of setting up Hugo; maybe that will be more useful.

Lots of love to GitHub, who host so many static sites without making us worry if everything will work correctly!
